# Ruby Linked List Implementation

The code provided is an implementation of a linked list data structure in `Ruby`. Linked lists are a type of data structure that consist of a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list.

The code uses two classes - `LinkedList` and `Node` - to implement the linked list. The `LinkedList` class contains methods for appending, prepending, inserting, removing, and finding nodes in the list. The `Node` class is used to create new nodes to be added to the linked list.

In the code, a new linked list is created, and several nodes are added to it using the `append` and `prepend` methods. The code then tests several other methods, including `size`, `contains`, `find`, `pop`, `at`, `insert_at`, and `remove_at`.

The code is written using the 'frozen_string_literal: true' pragma, which is used to ensure that string literals in the code are immutable. This helps to prevent bugs related to mutable strings in the code.
